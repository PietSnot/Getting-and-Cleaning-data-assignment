This repository contains the work that I've done for the assignment of the course
"Getting and Cleaning Data", from the Johns Hopkins school. This course is given
by Coursera on the internet.

I've done roughly the following:

1) I downloaded the raw material from the internet.

2) I opened the train/X_train.txt" in excel, split the data
   and saved it as csv, in order to easily read it in in R

3) in that same excel file ("features bewerkingen.xlsx", see
   repository) I also derived a lot of useful information. I extracted
   the column numbers that I wanted to keep, got all the column names,
   wrote some handy functions that I copied into the R program,
   like the vector of all column names, all column names for which
   I wanted to calculate the mean, et cetera.
   I used excel, because I find it much easier to use for these kind
   of things than R,

   If you do not have Excel, then LibreOffice or OpenOffice is fine
   as well. As I write this, I realize that the version of Excel I used
   is the dutch version, so I hope it will not give any language problems.

4) As said, I copied many of the strings created in Excel into my
   R program ("run_analysis.R").

Well, more information is available in the cookbook.md

I hope you enjoy reviewing my work.
